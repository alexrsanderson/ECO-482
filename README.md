# ECO-482
This is the machine learning project that I contributed to for ECO482 at the Univeristy of Toronto. I recommend reading the paper first, and have supplied the jupyter notebooks as well as the data. It is best to start off with the webscrape data and then look at the analysis notebook if you desire to look at the code.
